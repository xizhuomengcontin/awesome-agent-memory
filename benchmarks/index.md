# Benchmark Catalog

This directory is the benchmark layer of `awesome-agent-memory`. It sits beside
[`../papers/`](../papers/) and [`../products/`](../products/): paper notes own
scholarly claims, product notes own product behavior and vendor claims, and
benchmark notes own evaluation protocol, dataset shape, metrics, caveats, and
cross-source usage evidence.

## Scope

Include benchmarks that evaluate long-term memory, multi-session agent behavior,
personalization, forgetting, temporal reasoning, or memory-layer cost/quality
trade-offs. Adjacent RAG, long-context, and general agent benchmarks enter this
catalog only when memory papers or memory products use them for comparison.

Stub-quality paper entries can seed this index, but claims, score comparisons,
and recommendations must point to a full note, product archive, original paper,
official repository, dataset card, or independent reproduction.

## Evidence Ledgers

- [`claims/index.md`](claims/index.md) explains the usage-event schema and
  counting rules.
- [`claims/claims.yaml`](claims/claims.yaml) is the first structured ledger for
  benchmark usage, vendor self-claims, paper-origin events, and critiques.

## Counting Rules

Frequency tables must be split by evidence class:

- Raw mentions: all deduplicated benchmark events.
- Evaluation uses: `uses_for_eval`, `baseline_comparison`, and leaderboard use.
- Vendor claims: vendor-controlled product pages, blogs, and repos.
- Independent reproductions: third-party reruns with enough setup detail.
- Product-used benchmarks: benchmarks that memory products report against.
- Paper-origin reuse: paper-origin benchmarks used outside their origin paper.

Do not average scores across different models, splits, judges, or benchmark
subsets unless the setup matches and the comparison caveat is explicit.

## Maintenance

1. Add or update a benchmark note from [`_template.md`](_template.md).
2. Add usage events to [`claims/claims.yaml`](claims/claims.yaml).
3. Update [`../docs/benchmarks-landscape.md`](../docs/benchmarks-landscape.md)
   when the ledger changes enough to affect counts or conclusions.
4. Promote only full benchmark notes into ImpactReport evidence.
